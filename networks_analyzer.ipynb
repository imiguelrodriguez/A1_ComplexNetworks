    "## Part 1. Structural characterization of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find four different networks labelled as net1, net2, net3 and net4 in the activityA1.zip\n",
    "file.  To characterize their macroscopic structure, the students should analyze (at least) the following network descriptors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of nodes\n",
    "* Number of edges\n",
    "* Minimum, maximum, and average degree\n",
    "* Average clustering coefficient (average of the clustering coefficient of each node)\n",
    "* Assortativity\n",
    "* Average path length (average distance between all pairs of nodes)\n",
    "* Diameter (maximum distance between nodes in the network)\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these indicators, the degree distribution provides crucial information to understand the macroscopic structure of networks. For this reason, the students should obtain the degree distribution of each network and choose its most suitable representation (histogram in linear scale or in histogram in log-log scale with logarithmic binning).\n",
    "\n",
    "The microscopic structure of the network is instead characterized by analyzing different centralities for the nodes of the network. The students should list the 5 most central nodes according to different metrics (betweenness, degree, eigenvector) and comment the results. Are these centrality indicators providing the same information on the relevance of the nodes for the network?\n",
    "\n",
    "PS. Visualization of these networks using networkx is discouraged due to their large size."

The students should visualize the network (setting the positions of the nodes from the file ‘positions.txt’) and comment the most prominent features of the network. Is the network connected? Is it scale-free? Is the largest connected component a small-world network? From the visualization of the network, the students should propose an algorithm to generate the network. **Hint**: The algorithm starts by distributing the nodes randomly across space.\n",
